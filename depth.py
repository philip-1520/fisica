"""
Find the depth of a fall using the time measured between the release of an object and the sound of impact.

Parameters:
measured_time: measured time in seconds
iterations: maximum number of iterations that the code should execute
precision: number of decimal places in the result

Constants:
speed_of_sound: speed of sound (330.0 m/s)
g: gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/sÂ²)

Returns:
Tuple with the rounded depth and difference between the calculated and measured time
